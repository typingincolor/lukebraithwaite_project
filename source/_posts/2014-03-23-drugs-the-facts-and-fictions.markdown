All drugs are dangerous: this depends on the type and amount you take. If you take a large amount of drugs you are more likely to damage you health. This just like with classes of drugs; class A drugs do more damage than class B drugs and class B drugs do more damage than class C drugs.

Soft drugs lead to hard drugs: This is one of the greatest myths surrounding drug taking so if you take a class C drug like temazepam will not mean you will automatically mean you will be on hard drugs like Heroine; normally this happens because stuff like heroine is mixed into soft drugs so people get on hard drugs.
